## About the expo mobile app in typescript: :sparkle: 

## How to quick start the project:

### Clone the back and front repo 
####  :rainbow:	 For the back see my nest.js  https://github.com/shelleycavaness/nov_nest
/api/
express.js server in ES6
`npm run start:dev`

#### For the front :stars:	
:trumpet: Expo and react-native apps require a https!
##### :sparkle::sparkle::sparkle: Https Work-around:
I installed Ngrok to work around this issue because my develpment server was just a simple http one. In the Constants folder you will find ngrok.ts file that you can update with your https url from your ngrok development session. 
:speak_no_evil:

* [X] `expo start`
From here you will have several options for compilation. For a simple demo complie with expo's app from either the google store or apple store. scan the QR code on your telephone and the app will open and build your demo app. 
:see_no_evil:

If you just want to see the project in your browser you can skip the ngrok and use.
* [X] `expo start:web`
